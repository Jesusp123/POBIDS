## POBIDS
USE POWERBI TO ANALYZE AND VISUALISE A DATA SET

# STATEMENT

# DATASET
MULTIPLE DATASETS WHERE USED FOR THIS PROJECT

THE IMAGE SHOWS TWO MAIN PAGES OF THE REPORT MAIN AND DRILL-THROUGH
# PROCES S
1. CREATE MAIN PAGE THAT WOULD DEPICT COLLECTIVE DATA OF ALL COUNTRIES 
2. CREATE DRILL THROUGH PAGE TO DEPICT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES DATA
3. UPLOAD BEER CONSUMPTION DATASET
4. REMOVE ANY UNNECESSARY COLUMNS-ONLY LEAVE NAME,CODE, YEAR, LITERS
5. ADD COLUMN TO DATASET CALLED ERA USING SWITCH STATEMENT. WAS USED TO SHOW WHAT DECADE THE DATA WAS TAKEN FROM\
   CODE- ERA = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'beer'[Year]>=1960 && 'beer'[Year] < 1970,"Sixties",
    'beer'[Year]>1969 && 'beer'[Year] < 1980,"Seventies",
    'beer'[Year]>1979 && 'beer'[Year] < 1990,"Eighties",
    'beer'[Year]>1989 && 'beer'[Year] < 2000,"Nineties",
    'beer'[Year]>1999 && 'beer'[Year] < 2010,"Two-Thousands",
    'beer'[Year]>2009 && 'beer'[Year] <= 2019,"Two-Thousand-Tens",
    ISBLANK('beer'[Year]),"null")
